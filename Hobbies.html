  <h2 class="headingbar">Web Development & Programming</h2>
  <hr width="20%">
  <p>I enjoy using coding languages to carve out what I want onto my desktop or phone! I find it to be an interesting
    mix of creativity and logic that creates a unique form of expression that you cannot commonly find anywhere else. I
    enjoy being able to think logically to put together something creatively expressive!</p>
  <h2 class="headingbar">Gaming</h2>
  <hr width="20%">
  <p>I believe that gaming is a great medium for people who wish to tell a story. Every single part of the experience
    from visual, to gameplay, to what is and is not allowed for the player to do, is curated in specific ways for a
    specific story and experience to be told. I love seeing and dissecting the thought process behind games.</p>
  <h2 class="headingbar">Reading</h2>
  <hr width="20%">
  <p>Similar to gaming, I believe that the story telling in books are unique as well and that they can provide
    experiences that sometimes gaming cannot. Letting the imagination of the reader run wild but still within certain
    constraints lets you have a wider playground to work with when delivering a story through a book.</p>
